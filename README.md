## Please find a link to my [portfolio](https://github.com/CarbonSnitch/CarbonSnitch/blob/main/Data_Analyst_Portfolio_RGN_PDF.pdf) of completed Projects as well as a breakdown-below

### [1. COVID-19 Analysis of World Demographics from Before/After the global pandemic](https://github.com/CarbonSnitch/RGN_UN_COVID_19_2025/blob/main/UN_DATASET/Sent%20to%20Client/UN_COVID-19%20STORYBOARD_RGN_2025.pdf)

The Global pandemic significantly increased the death rate during the years 2020-2023. This analysis seeks to discover if it has returned back to a level that is comparable to pre-COVID-19 levels in 2025. In essence, is the pandemic officialy over in 2025? The Project deliverables included a [full presentation](https://github.com/CarbonSnitch/RGN_UN_COVID_19_2025/blob/main/UN_DATASET/Sent%20to%20Client/UN_COVID-19%20STORYBOARD_RGN_2025.pdf) as well as additional [3D-cluster plots created in Python](https://github.com/CarbonSnitch/RGN_UN_COVID_19_2025/blob/main/UN_DATASET/Sent%20to%20Client/Data_Analyst_Portfolio_COVID.pdf)

### [2. Forecasting staffing requirements for upcoming Flu-season in American states](https://github.com/CarbonSnitch/Influenza_Staffing_Requirements_RGN/blob/main/Sent%20to%20Client/Data_Analyst_Portfolio_Influenza.pdf)

#### The outcomes of this project were to:
 - Determine when influenza season begins and ends in the USA
 - Identify the potential vulnerable populations
 - Make predictions based upon the state-dependant normalised-vulnerable population as to whether more of less healthcare staff would be required in the upcoming flu season.

### [3. Rockbuster Stealth LLC. - SQL analysis to answer questionas relating to a company's core customer-base and most-successful products](https://github.com/CarbonSnitch/Portfolio_Rockbuster_SQL/blob/main/README.md)

#### The project goals were to answer questions such as:
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

Final project deliverables included a presentation of [data-driven answers](https://github.com/CarbonSnitch/Portfolio_Rockbuster_SQL/blob/main/Rockbuster_sent_to_client/Rockbuster_Presentation_RGN.pdf).

### [4. Analysis of NY bike-rental patterns to determine better bike disrtibution](https://carbonsnitch-ny-citibike-2022-st-dashboard-awrftk.streamlit.app/)

#### The project goals were to answer the questions of
- Is there a seasonality to the bike rentals?
- Is there a weather component to bike-rentals
- Which are the most-popular stations to rent from?
- How can we better distribute bikes so that we get less customer complaints?

Final Project deliverables include a [Streamlit Dashboard](https://carbonsnitch-ny-citibike-2022-st-dashboard-awrftk.streamlit.app/) and a video-presentation.

## Additional projects include a [analysis of an online Grocery Store customer base to determine customer-profile and value](https://github.com/CarbonSnitch/Portfolio_Instacart_Python/blob/main/05%20Sent%20to%20Client/Data_Analyst_Portfolio_Instacart.pdf)

![Customer buying frequency increases with number of past orders](https://github.com/CarbonSnitch/Portfolio_Instacart_Python/blob/main/04%20Analysis/Visualizations/Loyalty_Analysis_Portf.png)

## and an NLP analysis of a 20th-century-events wiki to determine the [most influential countries in the 20th century](https://github.com/CarbonSnitch/20th_century)
